# 'Whole-life' Individual

## **individual** Entity Type

One of the first HQDM patterns that is key to many of the more involved patterns is that of 'whole-life' [`individual`](https://github.com/hqdmTop/hqdmFramework/wiki/individual).

### Relations

## Implementation


Other properties may be chosen, or added, for additional data management purposes (e.g. logical deletion or data record copying).  They are described in the HQDM References below and are provided in the [`PatternsUtils.java`](https://github.com/ClimbingAl/code-for-hqdm-patterns/blob/cb73d64e61fda53b48af49f2793d6761ba79cd2a/thing/thing/src/main/java/patterns/hqdm/PatternsUtils.java#L31).

## Example
Instances of the whole-life `individual`, it's temporal parts, and HQDM dependencies generated by the [`IndividualExample`](https://github.com/ClimbingAl/code-for-hqdm-patterns/blob/prefixes/thing/thing/src/main/java/patterns/hqdm/ThingApp.java) and shown in this section.

Firstly, the `individual`, it's kind and directly related objects and properties

--8<-- "individualPattern.ttl"
```
While it is unusual to create instances of the `thing` entity-type, this is the data object structure that will be used for all its sub-types, with the only addition being relationships (as RDF predicates) that are committed in the HQDM model (and, therefore, its patterns).
