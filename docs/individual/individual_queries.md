## Queries related to the **individual** Entity Type

This section will be revised when all the worked examples are initially complete.  If you look in the code for the Apollo examples there are instances of these queries being implemented in Java (to compute over HQDM data objects) and in SPARQL (to fetch data from a triplestore holding the worked examples).

The sort of queries that may crop up when searching for all, or part, of an `individual`are:

1. What records do I have of the type `individual`?

2. What records do I have of the type `individual` (or any of its subtypes) that are members of a certain *kind*?

3. What records of states do I have of a particular `individual`?

4. I have a record of a `state`, what `individual`(s) is it a temporal part of?
