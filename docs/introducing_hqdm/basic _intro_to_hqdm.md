# What HQDM is, and isn't

* HQDM is a conceptual model with formal foundations to enable data integration for any, and all, enterprise businsess applications.

* HQDM isn't compatible with established data modelling tools and query languages without careful implementation choices.

* HQDM is a data model that can be used as it is documented.  This documentation covers doing just this.

* HQDM isn't the easiest model to learn BUT it becomes by far the most practical choice when the structures and patterns are employed to expolit the inherrent properties (like extensibility, immutability and additivity).
