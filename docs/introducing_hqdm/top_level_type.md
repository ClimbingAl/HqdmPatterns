# Top Level Type

## **Thing**
The root entity type is [thing](https://github.com/hqdmTop/hqdmFramework/wiki/thing).  All HQDM data objects, however they are represented, are instances of this *type*.  

``` mermaid
graph TD
  id1[Thing];
  style id1 stroke-width:4px;
  id2[spatio_temporal <br\> _extent] & id3[abstract_object];
  id1-->|supertype_of|id2;
  id1-->|supertype_of|id3;
  id4[class];
  id3-->|supertype_of|id4;
  id1-...->|member__of|id4;
```

## Implementation
To use HQDM as an implementation model directly a number of properties are recommended for each record (data object):

| Property | Required | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| id | Yes | A unique identifier for this object |
| record_created | Yes | The date-time stamp for the object's creation |
| record_creator | Recommended | The user, organisation or system that created the record |
| entity_name | Recommended | A human readable initial name for the object* |

\* - For advanced uses of HQDM this is not needed and may even be counter-productive but it aids familiarisation and debugging.

Other properties may be chosen, or added, for additional data management purposes (e.g. logical deletion or data record copying).  They are described in the HQDM References below and are provided in the [PatternsUtils.java](https://github.com/ClimbingAl/code-for-hqdm-patterns/blob/cb73d64e61fda53b48af49f2793d6761ba79cd2a/thing/thing/src/main/java/patterns/hqdm/PatternsUtils.java#L31).

## Example
Instance of ```thing``` generated by the [ThingExample](https://github.com/ClimbingAl/code-for-hqdm-patterns/blob/prefixes/thing/thing/src/main/java/patterns/hqdm/ThingApp.java).

``` mermaid
graph LR
  id1((patterns: <br> 7a14739a-7bdd-49a0- <br> a935-3ef41f0cf955)) --->|patterns-rdl:record_created| p1(2023-08-01T10:40:51.880960800Z);
  id1 --->|patterns-rdl:record_creator| p2(HqdmPatternProject_User1);
  id1 --->|hqdm:EntityName| p3(Example_Thing_As_Instance_Of_ <br> TopLevelHQDM_EntityType_THING);
```

``` title="Thing object in TURTLE" hl_lines="5-8"
--8<-- "thing.ttl"
```
While it is unusual to create instances of the ```thing``` entity-type, this is the data object structure that will be used for all its sub-types, with the only addition being relationships (as RDF predicates) that are committed in the HQDM model (and, therefore, its patterns).
