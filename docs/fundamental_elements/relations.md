# Relations

Relations in a Top Level Data Model, and data based on it, are fundamental and have some formal characteristics.  They represent what one item (thing/object/type, etc) has to do with another AND about which there is "nothing more to say" [Ref M West quote].  If a relationship is expressed between two items then it is logically present (`TRUE`).  However, these binary relations are more restricted than the relations present in mathematical set theory (e.g. they can't be symmetric).  They always have an order, and therefore, represent a set of ordered pairs or an ordered pair that is an element of such a set.
